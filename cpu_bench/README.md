# Simple CPU-Benchmark tool, that stress the CPU to the LIMIT!
This simple code will push your CPU to the LIMIT.

Warning: High temperatures expected. 

## Notes
For now, there is no baseline between scores of multiple machines. 
I use this to compare machines that I use for work. For example, some references: 
 - AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX (32 cores, 64 threads) ~ 1700-1900
 - Intel Core i7-13700K (16 cores, 24 threads) ~ 2000-2100
 - Virtual Machine Intel Xeon (???) (8 cores, 8 threads) ~ 400-500
